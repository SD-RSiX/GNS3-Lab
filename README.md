It is a network lab designed for SDN approaches prototyping for [Internet Exchange Points (IXP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point). This project has been developed together with [\[SD\]RSiX Controller](https://bitbucket.org/sd-rsix/sd-rsix-controller/overview) project, although, it does not require an OpenFlow controller to run and can be used and extended as a regular networking Lab - check the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/sd-rsix/sd-rsix-lab/wiki/Home) for details.

The Lab was based on the [RSiX Internet Exchange (Rio Grande do Sul IXP - Porto Alegre) Infrastructure](http://ix.br/adesao/rs/) (in a reduced scale) and [connected ASes](http://ix.br/particip/rs), and it mirrors the services and configurations in use in Brazilian IXPs.
